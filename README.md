# Sim2Seismic: generation of synthetic seismogram

### Honggeun Jo and Hyunmin Kim Assistant Professor, Inha University (Korea)

This demo showcases an implementation of converting acoustic properties into a seismogram. In this demonstration, we first import the following elements:
1. Model rasterization information
1. Top/bottom surface data
1. Wavelet element

Currently, we use random values for density and Vp, which will eventually need to be calculated from simulation results such as pressure, temperature, saturation, and porosity. 

The demo is presented by Honggeun Jo, an Assistant Professor at Inha University (Korea).
